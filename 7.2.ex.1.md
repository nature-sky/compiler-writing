*operater grammer* contains no rules of the form 𝑉 → 𝛼𝑋𝑌𝜷, where 𝑋, 𝑌 ∈ 𝑉~𝑁~.
This means that at least one terminal is in the right-hand side 𝑉 → 𝛼𝑋𝑥𝑌𝜷, where 𝑋, 𝑌 ∈ 𝑉~𝑁~, 𝑥 ∈ 𝑉~𝑡~.
In the each of derivations, the at least one terminal is between each nonterminals in the sentential form, so any sentential form in an operator grammer cannot contain two consecutive nonterminals.
