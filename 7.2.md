# 7.1 Operator Precedence Grammars

In Sec. 7-1 we use input and stack precedence functions (f and g), which establishing precedence relations between symbols, to convert infix expression to their suffix Polish equivalents.

This section introduces a method, which establishing precedence relations between the **operator symbol(terminal) of a grammar**. Next section gives a generalization of this method to involve precedence relations between **all symbols(terminal and nonterminal) of a grammar**.

## 7-2.1 Notions and Use of Operator Precedence Relations

The idea of operator precedence is generalized in this subsection. An informal understanding of this generalization can be obtained through the use of syntax tree. The term *operator* means a member of the terminal alphabet, V~T~.

The parsing method is a bottom-up technique in left-to-right manner without backup and *is not a converse rightmost derivation*.

The generalization of the precedence functions results in precedence relations between operator (terminal) symbols only. Relations between nonterminal symbols are not concerned. There is at least one operator symbol in each point when the string of symbols reduced.

This class of grammars is the subject of the discussion in this section.

*   Definition 7-1

    A grammar G is an *operator grammar* if is contains no rules of the form 𝑉 → 𝛼𝑋𝑌𝜷, where 𝑋, 𝑌 ∈ 𝑉~𝑁~; that is, the occurrence of consecutive nonterminals in the right part of any rule is forbidden. Also, empty rules are not permitted. We call the language generated by an operator grammar an *operator language*.

    This is an example in which the start symbol is *E*:

        E → T | E + T | E - T
        T → F | T * F | T / F
        F → P | F ↑ P
        P → i | ( E )

The operator language associated with this grammar is the set of parenthesized arithmetic expressions consisting of variables and operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponention.

A *prime phrase* is a phrase which must contain at least one terminal symbol of the grammar, but no prime phrase other than itself.
The sentential form

    P * P / (i + T)

contains only the prime phrase P * P and i. All other phrases either are nonterminals or contains one of these prime phrases. The method is reducing the leftmost prime phrase at each stage in the parse, classfied as a left-to-right method.
